FreeCodeCamp: Image Search Abstraction Layer
=========================

- I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.
- I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.
- I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.

Usage: 
<br />https://roldeguz-image-search.glitch.me/imagesearch/lolcats%20funny?offset=10 for image search
<br />https://roldeguz-image-search.glitch.me/latest/imagesearch/ will return recent searches
